It improves usability since ENS is well integrated within wallets - making it easier to transfer funds to your friends or interact with known contracts. In this part of the lab, you will set up an ENS name for one of your wallets on Sepolia. Please follow the steps below:\n","\n","- Go to the ENS web app at https://alpha.ens.domains\n","- Type in a preferred name and pick it if available - Note that the name will be available in public, so choose a pseudonymous name so that your wallet address cannot be linked back to your real name. Use the form of `name.eth`.\n","- Start the timer - the timer ensures that there is no front-running attack on ENS\n","- Register the name after the wait\n","\n","How does the timer mechanism prevent front running? Hint: The address who submits the commit and the reveal first gets the name, and there should be a minimum 1-minute gap between the commit and reveal\n","\n","Try out your ENS by sending yourself eth on metamask using your ENS. (This is available on mainnet.)\n","\n","# Interacting with OpenSea to mint and sell NFTs\n","\n","Opensea is a marketplace for minting, buying, and selling NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. In this lab, you will be minting an NFT, listing it for sale, and buying an NFT listed by your neighbor. Please follow the steps below:\n","\n","## Visit your profile on OpenSea\n","\n","- Go to OpenSea at [https://testnets.opensea.io/](https://testnets.opensea.io/)\n","- Connect wallet and go to profile (under colored circle in top right).\n","- Check out your NFTs (NameWrapper is your ens); Uniswap V3 is the NFTs representing V3 LP positions you took in labs earlier.\n","\n","## Mint an NFT\n","\n","- Go to create (also under the colored circle in the top right).\n","- Upload a photograph (or any content you own) or make one using AI here: [https://limewire.com/studio/image/create-image](https://limewire.com/studio/image/create-image)\n","- Refer to official support [here](https://support.opensea.io/en/articles/8867023-how-do-i-create-an-nft?_gl=1*b6nlyb*_ga*MTA3NjAwOTk3MS4xNzE0MDI3NjU0*_ga_9VSBF2K4BX*MTcxNDAzMjc5OS4yLjEuMTcxNDAzNDQ1Ny4wLjAuMA..).\n","\n","\n","## List and buy NFTs\n","\n","- List your NFT for 0.01 ETH.\n","\n","Work with a friend or use your second wallet:\n","\n","- Search for the user's wallet whose NFT you want to buy. (If you are working with a partner, you can resolve their ENS at [https://alpha.ens.domains/](https://alpha.ens.domains/)) (On mainnet, this would happen on OpenSea automatically.)\n","- Buy their NFT and wait for confirmation.\n","\n","## Transfer and see class NFTs\n","\n","- Resolve the ens `name.eth` at [https://alpha.ens.domains/](https://alpha.ens.domains/) and copy the address\n","- Click on the transfer button on the top right (Right facing send arrow) and send your NFT to the address it resolved.\n","- View the wallet and see the NFTs made by your peers.\n","- If there is a mistake for creating NFT on the testnet, you can click the example [here](https://testnets.opensea.io/zh-CN/assets/sepolia/0x244ddaf1c0b8237312b3035f1e99b0bb93d10f22/0) to know how to bid via WETH. You can wrap ETH to WETH by clicking the wallet information on the top right corner.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Exploring an ERC721 NFT collection\n","\n","In this lab, we will be taking a deep dive into an ERC 721 contract and understanding how an NFT is stored. We will looking at an NFT collection called [Doodles](https://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official); their contract can be found at [https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code). Please follow the steps below:\n","\n","- Visit this contract, specifically looking at `Doodles.sol` and `ERC721.sol`.\n","- Specifically, note and understand the connection between the `setBaseURI` method in `Doodles.sol` and the `tokenURI` method in `ERC721.sol`, which is what allows the storage of a URI for each token's metadata.\n","- Access the read contract tab, and call the Token URI method on a token id of your choice other than `1`.\n","- Example output for token id `1`: `ipfs://QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1`\n","- This is the IPFS URI where the token's metadata is stored (off-chain). To access this link within your browser, you will generate a URL using Cloudflare's IPFS gateway. To do so, replace `ipfs://` with `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/` for your token URI.\n","  - Example:\n","  https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1\n","\n","    Output:\n","    ```\n","    {\"image\":\"ipfs:\\/\\/QmTDxnzcvj2p3xBrKcGv1wxoyhAn2yzCQnZZ9LmFjReuH9\",\"name\":\"Doodle #1\",\"description\":\"A community-driven collectibles project featuring art by Burnt Toast.

This process highlights that images/metadata are not always stored on-chain; the NFT is solely the ERC-721 token itself - not the media stored alongside it.\n","\n","# Viewing an \"On-Chain\" NFT Collection\n","\n","Some NFT collections generate their media data on-chain via programmatic execution within the smart contract; we will take a look at the Pixels collection on OpenSea as an example:\n","\n","- Access and interact with a project called The Pixels on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/the-pixels-inc.\n","- Examine the contract at https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ff2a00ff543f913b76010a05b5446e36d403675#code.\n","- Specifically, examine `ThePixelsDNAFactory.sol` where the token images & metadata are programmatically generated on-chain.\n","\n","- Are animations and metadata still stored off-chain on a proprietary API? You can check this using the Token URI method to see where and what metadata is stored.\n","\n","# Minting an NFT\n","\n","We have created a custom NFT contract for this class; it generates SVG images using on-chain logic associated with the token ID to be minted.\n","\n","- Access our ERC-721 NFT contract at: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5a4376a4804350e5e9087368cfcf62d2a6067922](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5a4376a4804350e5e9087368cfcf62d2a6067922)\n","- Examine the contract, specifically the `mintNFT` and `generateImage` methods that are not part of the ERC721 standard as well as the overridden `TokenURI` method for the on-chain metadata.\n","- Use the write tab on Etherscan to call the mint method, which will mint an NFT to your address.
