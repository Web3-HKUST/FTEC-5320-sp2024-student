    "## Send assets across different blockchains\n",
    "The objective here is to get a wrapped version of ETH tokens on the Amoy chain. To do this, we follow these steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the GUI for the [bridge between Sepolia and Amoy](https://portal.polygon.technology/bridge) and connect your MetaMask.\n",
    "2. Select ETH token and the Sepolia testnet in the \"From\" field.\n",
    "3. Enter the amount of ETH you wish to transfer - say 0.01 ETH.\n",
    "4. Click Transfer.\n",
    "5. Confirm the transaction via MetaMask.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view your transaction on Etherscan. If you go to the transactions tab on the Polygon portal, you should be able to see a pending transaction. If you click on it, it will reveal the Sepolia transaction hash. The transaction will transfer your ETH to a [certain smart contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x930c824c1e423a4b4949c665c4e92bd8f6ccf04e) that is supposed to notify a committee of bridge managers (who are off-chain) that a transaction has happened on one chain (Sepolia/Ethereum). The committee then votes on approving a set of corresponding transactions on the other chain (Amoy/Polygon)."

    "\n",
    "[This is the testnet bridge website](https://testnetbridge.com/sepolia) and its smart contract deployed on Sepolia is [this](https://testnetbridge.com/sepolia/how). The contract swaps the native token on each net (ETH on mainnet and SepoliaETH on Sepolia) with a wrapped version of the token on the destination net (SETH on mainnet and METH on sepolia). [There is a uniswap pool](https://testnetbridge.com/pools) between METH and SepoliaETH on the Sepolia testnet. Similarly, there is a pool between SETH and ETH on the mainnet. Each of these wrapped tokens have a bridge that is managed by LayerZero's validators that mint tokens on destination chain when respective tokens are deposited on one chain. For instance, when METH is sent to the bridge on Sepolia, it gives ETH on mainnet to the corresponding address.\n",

    "## Wrapping UETH token\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of wrapping ERC20 tokens themselves is essential for utilizing them within the Ethereum ecosystem for staking, governance, and other actions. This is primarily due to the different token standards and functionalities they possess. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping ERC20 tokens allows users to convert them into a compatible format for a particular protocol, generally referred to as wrapped tokens. This conversion is crucial for staking purposes, as many decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and protocols require tokens to be in a specific format to participate in staking pools, liquidity provision, or yield farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, wrapped tokens facilitate a more streamlined governance process within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other blockchain projects. By ensuring compatibility with various smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network, wrapped tokens enable users to participate in voting, proposal submission, and other governance-related actions with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume you want to wrap the UETH token. Given below is an incomplete contract that you should fill in. You can refer the document of ERC20 for these functions [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20)."
