        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "[Flash Loans](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans) are special transactions that allow the borrowing of an asset, as long as the borrowed amount (and a fee) is returned before the end of the transaction (also called One Block Borrows). These transactions do not require a user to supply collateral prior to engaging in the transaction. There is no real world analogy to Flash Loans, so it requires some basic understanding of how state is managed within blocks in blockchains.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Execution Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "Flash Loans typically operate similar to the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Your contract calls the public Flash Loan function (eg. `flashLoan`) on the protocol's contract\n",
        "- The protocol's contract sends you the requested funds and then calls a designated callback function defined in your contract (eg. `executeOperation`)\n",
        "- The protocol's contract ensures that you have enough funds to repay the borrowed amount (plus a fee) and reclaims those funds\n",
        "\n",
        "The `executeOperation` function in your contract can perform any arbitrary logic using the funds. Once it finishes, execution returns back to the calling protocol contract where it can transfer the borrowed funds back to itself and ensure the entire amount is repaid. If you no longer have enough funds to repay the borrowed amount by the last step, the entire transaction will fail. As a result, the protocol can let anyone borrow any amount with no risk of losing assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Flashloan Contract\n",
        "\n",
        "Your contract that receives the flash loaned amounts must conform to the [IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver.sol](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/flashloan/interfaces/IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver.sol) or IFlashLoanReceiver.sol interface by implementing the relevant `executeOperation` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using a standard ethereum account, we need to send a transaction to the appropriate Pool to invoke the flashLoan() or [flashLoanSimple()](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#flashloansimple) function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
